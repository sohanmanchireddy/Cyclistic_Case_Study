# Cyclistic Case Study

This case study was completed as part of the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
I used the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act, to complete the business task of the assignment.

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

#### Business Task: 


How do annual members and casual riders use Cylclistic bikes differently?

#### Overall Business Goal:

#### Proposed Deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task

5. Supporting visualizations and key findings 
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
