# Cyclistic Case Study

This case study was completed as part of the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
I used the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act, to complete the business task of the assignment.

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

#### Business Task: 


How do annual members and casual riders use Cylclistic bikes differently?

#### Overall Business Goal: 

Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

### About the Company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles 
that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and 
returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One 
approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, 
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who 
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.	

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the 
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will 
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a 
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program 
and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
